## What is "AOC" ?
"Advent of Code" is an annual programming challenge that takes place every December. It consists of a series of daily programming puzzles that are released on the Advent of Code website. The puzzles are designed to be fun and challenging, and they cover a variety of topics, including algorithms, data structures, cryptography, and more.

Each puzzle typically involves solving a problem using programming, and participants can use any programming language they prefer. The puzzles start off relatively easy, but they get progressively harder as the days go on. Participants can earn points by solving the puzzles quickly and accurately, and there is a leaderboard that shows the top participants.

Advent of Code has become a popular event for programmers around the world, and it is a great way to practice programming skills, learn new techniques, and connect with other programmers.

## How many Puzzles in AOC ?

"Advent of Code" typically consists of 25 puzzles, one for each day in December leading up to Christmas. Each puzzle is released at midnight EST (UTC-5) on its respective day, and participants have 24 hours to solve the puzzle and submit their answers to the website. However, the puzzles remain available on the website year-round, so participants can still access them and solve them even after December is over.
